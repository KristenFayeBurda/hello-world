Kristen Faye Burda Hello World Repository
I graduated from Yale University, magna cum laude and with membership in Phi Beta Kappa, having earned a B.A. with distinction in theater studies as well as significant coursework in psychology. In Los Angeles, I concurrently pursued a professional acting career, attaining membership in SAG-AFTRA, and a specialized educational career, tutoring high school, college, and graduate students with learning differences. I then moved to Vancouver, Canada, where I worked in the mental health field as executive director of the Canadian Bipolar Association, establishing a bipolar-specific peer support program, and leader of a few community groups at Hollyburn Family Services, teaching acting to members of vulnerable populations. I now work as a case manager at Conard House in San Francisco, serve on the Board of Directors at Queer LifeSpace, volunteer for Crisis Text Line, and will begin my doctoral studies at The Wright Institute in August 2017. I aim to support others in mental health recovery and to engage in my own creative expression.
